<h1>DJ Raffe</h1>




<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>DJ Raffe is a tool for developing a child's skill with polyrhythm, a rhythm that makes use of two or more different rhythms simultaneously. DJ Raffe does this by providing the ability to overlay measures with two separate beat meters and play the resulting polyrhythm on two drums, one for each hand.<br><br>

The learning process is iterative, first presenting the right hand's rhythm, allowing the child to master it, and then moving to the left hand's rhythm. As soon as each of these respective rhythms are learned separately, the third and final step presented by the interface is the combination of both hands' rhythms.<br><br>

Children can select the two meters they wish to overlay and can also adjust the tempo of the polyrhythm. Upon clicking the Play button, the notes representing the rhythms are streamed to the left in the window. In addition, an animated giraffe (hence, DJ Raffe) passes a tree at the bottom of the screen on the first beat of each measure in order to give a visual representation of the passing of time and the structure of the actual measure.</p>
